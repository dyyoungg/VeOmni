## Trainer Hierarchy

A training job splits in two. `VeOmniModelRuntime` (`veomni/models/model_runtime.py`) owns everything bound to *one* model; `BaseTrainer` *holds* one as `trainer.model` and adds everything bound to the *job*, of which there is exactly one. A single-model job is one runtime inside one trainer; a composed omni model is many runtimes under one orchestrator, which is why the trainer composes the runtime rather than inheriting it — `OmniTrainer` holds several and could not inherit them all.

`trainer.model` is therefore the runtime, not the raw module. It forwards unshadowed `nn.Module` APIs (`.parameters()`, `.config`) via `__getattr__` and forwards `trainer.model(**batch)` via `__call__`, so most call sites read unchanged; the real `nn.Module` is at `trainer.model.model`. Model construction and sharding stay inside the runtime. Legacy checkpoint callbacks unwrap `runtime.model` and use its optimizer and scheduler at the DCP boundary.

What a trainer holds:

```
BaseTrainer (ABC)                     job: data, train_step, loop, callbacks
└── .model: VeOmniModelRuntime        one model: build, freeze/LoRA, parallelize,
    └── .model: nn.Module             optimizer, lr-scheduler, clip, ParallelState

CheckpointerCallback / HuggingfaceCkptCallback / HFLoraCkptCallback
    own DCP, per-rank extra state and exports using the pre-merge layout.
```

What holds a `BaseTrainer`:

```
TextTrainer / VLMTrainer / DiTTrainer / TextDPOTrainer  compose `self.base`
BaseRLTrainer (ABC)  subclasses BaseTrainer
├── (text RL)           -> tasks/train_text_rl.py
└── (VLM RL)            -> tasks/train_vlm_rl.py
```

`VeOmniModelRuntime` contributes the model-bound half. `setup()` only registers this model's mesh. `__init__` then wraps the mesh-dependent build in `use_parallel_state(self.model_name)`:
- `_build_model()` -> meta-init through the registry-aware loader
- `_freeze_model_module()` / `_setup_lora()` -> trainable surface
- `_build_parallelized_model()` -> FSDP2/DDP wrap + weight load
- `_build_optimizer()` -> optimization

then, outside that scope (these do not need ambient groups):
- `_build_model_assets()` -> the preprocessor this model reads inputs through, the `model_assets` sidecars an export writes beside its weights, and `chat_template` when the job named one

and past construction:
- `_build_lr_scheduler(total_steps)` -> left to the trainer, since `total_steps` is only known once the dataset is built
- `clip_grad_norm()` -> gradient clipping under this model's mesh

Which preprocessor a model gets follows from what the checkpoint holds, not from a declaration: `_build_model_assets` always calls `build_processor`, since `AutoProcessor` falls back to `AutoTokenizer` when a repository has no processor to offer. If a real `ProcessorMixin` comes back, `processor` is set and `tokenizer` is taken from inside it (never loaded twice, so the object the data pipeline reads through is the object exported); otherwise only `tokenizer` is set. `processor is not None` is therefore the job's signal that a model sees more than text. `DiTModelRuntime` overrides this to load neither. A path with no preprocessor to load warns rather than raises — a toy config exercising the loop on synthetic batches has none and never asks for one.

The same method assembles `model_assets`, the sidecars an export writes beside the weights: the config always, plus whatever preprocessor loaded. Caching the list is safe because nothing replaces or rewrites those objects afterwards. This mirrors SeedOmni V2's `ModuleRuntime._load_module_assets`. It also builds `chat_template` when this model named one (`model.chat_template`), because the template is the third thing a model needs before it can read text: the tokenizer says how a string becomes ids, the processor how pixels do, and the template how a *conversation* becomes a training sample — including the assistant-only label mask no jinja can express. A trainer therefore never assembles one; it reads `model.chat_template` the way it reads `model.tokenizer`, and always forwards it to `build_data_transform` (transforms take `**kwargs`, so one that has no use for it ignores it). The field defaults to `None`: a config asks for a template by naming one and otherwise gets none (plaintext with no conversation to lay out, or a Qwen-Omni job that formats through its processor). A model that loaded no preprocessor (a DiT over latents) warns and leaves it unset rather than failing a build with no use for one.

The template is not in `model_assets` and is not written onto the tokenizer: it is a data-layout choice, so an export keeps the checkpoint's jinja.

`model.processor_config` is forwarded as kwargs to `build_processor` the way `model_config` overrides the architecture. Pixel budgets belong in `data.mm_configs`, which resizes before the processor sees the image.

So `self.model = self._build_model_runtime()` *is* the model build — a trainer never resequences those steps from outside, and needs no `use_parallel_state` scope around anything that follows. A model whose build differs subclasses the runtime and overrides the step that differs: `VLMModelRuntime` (encoder-aware build, tower freezing, separate ViT lr), `DiTModelRuntime` (frozen condition model; nothing to parallelize on an embedding-only run), and `DPOReferenceModelRuntime` (frozen eval replica under `"reference"`; init only builds the module, never optimizer / checkpoint). `TextDPOTrainer` owns both handles as `policy_model` (ParallelState `"policy"`) and `reference_model`. Callbacks bind to the DPO trainer; `.model` is the policy. The frozen reference always copies `model`; a custom reference-model config is not supported. Each is returned from `_build_policy_model_runtime()` / `_build_reference_model_runtime()`.

It is usable on its own, with no trainer at all (see `tests/models/test_model_runtime.py`). Construction takes this model's *own* arguments (`ModelArguments`), the `ParallelState` name to register under, and the job-wide `TrainingArguments` it still needs for checkpoint paths and the resume decision. Nothing has to find itself inside a larger config: a job composing several models hands each one its own slice, so a single-model trainer and a multi-module omni model share one build sequence.

Checkpointing retains the pre-merge callback implementation. `CheckpointerCallback`
writes model and optimizer together in `checkpoints/global_step_{N}/`, with the
scheduler, dataloader cursor, RNG and meters in
`extra_state/extra_state_rank_{R}.pt`. `HuggingfaceCkptCallback` exports into
that step's `hf_ckpt/`; `HFLoraCkptCallback` exports into
`output_dir/global_step_{N}/`. `BaseTrainer` checkpoint methods delegate to
these callbacks. They also support the existing plain-model llava trainer.

No separate model checkpoint manager, global-state callback, manifest or local
staging is enabled. The retained runtime is unwrapped only at this checkpoint
boundary; its model-building and optimization responsibilities are unchanged.
See `docs/usage/checkpoint.md` for the on-disk contract.

`BaseTrainer` adds the job-bound half:
- `_build_dataloader()` -> data pipeline setup
- `train_step()` -> single training step (forward + backward + update)
- `training_loop()` -> main loop with callbacks

Subclasses override specific methods (e.g., `compute_loss()`, custom data transforms) rather than the entire training loop. Note that `TextTrainer`, `VLMTrainer`, `DiTTrainer` and `TextDPOTrainer` *compose* a `BaseTrainer` in `self.base` rather than subclassing it, and drive the build steps one at a time (constraint 24).

**Parallel-state scoping**: `BaseTrainer._setup(args)` registers `"base"` via `init_parallel_state_from_config` before seed/determinism — it is a staticmethod because everything it does is job-level and runs before any model exists. A model then derives its own mesh in `VeOmniModelRuntime.setup()`; `VeOmniModelRuntime.__init__` scopes the mesh-dependent build to that mesh, so the trainer's remaining build steps need no scope of their own. Run time is **per-op**: `forward_backward_step` wraps `use_parallel_state(self.model.parallel_state)` around forward, postforward, and backward so none of them hard-code `"base"` (DPO wraps policy vs reference itself). `clip_grad_norm()` still wraps itself. The `parallel_state` property is a by-name registry lookup, never a stored state object, so the registry stays the single source of truth. See `.agents/knowledge/constraints.md` §7 and `docs/design/local_parallel_state.md`.

```

## Model Loading Flow

1. Read `config.json` -> `AutoConfig.from_pretrained()` -> check `MODEL_CONFIG_REGISTRY`
2. If registered: use VeOmni custom config class; else: use HF config
3. Determine model class via `MODELING_REGISTRY` (keyed by `model_type`)
4. Instantiate model on meta device (`init_empty_weights()`)
5. Apply VeOmni patches (flash attention, sequence parallel hooks)
6. Load weights (`load_model_weights()` or `rank0_load_and_broadcast_weights()`)
7. Apply parallelization (`build_parallelize_model()`)

## Parallelization Flow

VeOmni uses FSDP2 exclusively.

1. `init_parallel_state_from_config()` -> global `DeviceMesh` with named dims (`dp_shard`, `ulysses`, `cp`, etc.) + per-ExtraParallel submeshes (`[ep × ep_fsdp]`)
2. Model-specific `parallel_plan.py` -> define EP/embedding weight sharding via `ParallelPlan`
3. `build_parallelize_model()` -> `parallelize_model_fsdp2()`:
   - `ParallelPlan.apply()` wraps EP/embedding params as DTensors on para mesh
   - `fully_shard()` on EP modules with `ep_fsdp` submesh (Shard(1) for hidden dim)
   - `fully_shard()` on each transformer block with `fsdp_mesh`
   - `fully_shard()` on root model
4. SP is orthogonal to FSDP2 — models call Ulysses all-to-all (`gather_seq_scatter_heads` / `gather_heads_scatter_seq`) around attention; the FSDP shard mesh fuses with SP mesh (`dp_shard_sp`)
5. EP token routing is in model MoE code + `moe_layer.py` using `ep_group` from `ParallelState`

### Test Commands by Change Area

| Change in | Test command |
|-----------|-------------|
| `veomni/models/` | `pytest tests/models/` |
| `veomni/data/` | `pytest tests/data/` |
| `veomni/ops/` | `pytest tests/ops/` |
| `veomni/distributed/` | `pytest tests/parallel/ tests/distributed/` |
| `veomni/checkpoint/` | `pytest tests/checkpoints/` |
| `veomni/utils/` | `pytest tests/utils/` |
| `veomni/trainer/` | `pytest tests/trainer/`, then `pytest tests/e2e/` for loop changes |
| `veomni/lora/` | `pytest tests/lora/` |
| `veomni/optim/` | `pytest tests/optim/` |
| Full regression | `pytest tests/` |

Distributed tests (`tests/parallel/`, `tests/distributed/`, `tests/e2e/`) may require multiple GPUs and use `torchrun` or `tests/tools/launch_utils.py`.

**A passing local run does not mean CI runs it.**
`.github/workflows/gpu_unit_tests.yml` and `npu_unit_tests.yml` enumerate most
test files one by one. Only `tests/data` runs as a whole directory in both
workflows; `tests/ops` and `tests/parallel/context_parallel` run wholesale on
GPU only (the NPU job enumerates three named ops files). The e2e paths belong
to `gpu_e2e_test.yml` / `npu_e2e_test.yml` instead. A new file anywhere else is
invisible to CI until it is added to the workflow that owns its path, usually
both unit workflows. See `.agents/knowledge/testing.md` before adding a test.
