"""The model-bound half of a training job.

:class:`VeOmniModelRuntime` owns everything that belongs to *one* model —
build, freeze/LoRA, parallelize + weight load, optimizer, lr-scheduler,
gradient clipping and the device mesh they all read. It deliberately owns
nothing job-bound: no process-group init, no dataloader, no train loop, no
callbacks. A job has exactly one of those; it may have many models.

This split is what lets a single-model trainer and a multi-module omni model
share one build sequence instead of maintaining divergent copies of it.

    """One model's training unit: build → freeze/LoRA → parallelize → optimizer → clip.

    This is a *model handle*, not a trainer base class. A trainer holds one
    (``trainer.model``) the way :class:`~veomni.trainer.omni.omni_trainer.OmniTrainer`
    holds an ``OmniModelRuntime``. The wrapped :class:`torch.nn.Module`
    lives at :attr:`model`; every other module API is forwarded by
    :meth:`__getattr__`, so ``trainer.model.parameters()`` and
    ``trainer.model.config`` keep working while the handle itself owns the
    training lifecycle.

    Checkpoint callbacks unwrap this handle before passing its module and
    optimizer to DCP. They retain the existing combined checkpoint and
    per-rank extra-state format.

    Constructing one *builds* it — ``VeOmniModelRuntime(args)`` comes back with a
    parallelized model and its optimizer, because everything that build touches
    (meta-init, FSDP2/TP/EP wrap, weight load, EP-aware optimizer) reads the
    ambient :class:`ParallelState`, and the only place that can be scoped once,
    for every caller, is inside the runtime that owns the mesh. A trainer is then
    free of it: ``self.model = self._build_model_runtime()`` and the job-level
    steps that follow need no scope of their own.

    Construction takes this model's *own* arguments — not the job's — plus the
    :attr:`model_name` its :class:`ParallelState` registers under, so a job
    composing several models hands each one its own slice and its own mesh
    without any of them having to know how to find itself inside a larger
    config. ``train_args`` comes alongside because a handful of decisions are
    genuinely job-wide: where checkpoints are written, and whether a resume path
    makes the initial HF weight load redundant (see :attr:`skip_hf_weight_load`).
    The constructor still takes ``train=``; storing it as ``train_args`` leaves
    :meth:`train` free to forward ``nn.Module.train()``.

    Which chat template to build is on this model's arguments
    (``model.chat_template``); only the runtime holds the preprocessor to
    build it from.

    A model whose build differs (a VLM freezing its tower, a DiT carrying a
    condition model) subclasses this and overrides the step that differs, rather
    than the trainer resequencing the build from outside.

    The lr scheduler is the one piece deliberately left out: it needs
    ``total_steps``, which is only known once the dataset has been built, so the
    trainer calls :meth:`_build_lr_scheduler` later.

        Also assembles :attr:`model_assets`, the sidecars an export writes beside
        this model's weights, and :attr:`chat_template` when this model named one.
        The config is always among the sidecars; the preprocessor joins it if
        there was one to load. The chat template is not in that list and is not
        written onto the tokenizer: it is a data-layout choice, so an export
        keeps the checkpoint's jinja.

        ``processor_config`` is forwarded as kwargs to ``build_processor``, the
        way ``model_config`` overrides the architecture.

        Which preprocessor it is follows from what the checkpoint actually
        holds, not from a declaration the model makes about itself.
        ``AutoProcessor`` falls back to ``AutoTokenizer`` when a repository has
        no processor to offer, so one load answers both cases — and the answer
        is trustworthy in a way a declaration is not, since a multimodal
        repository missing its ``preprocessor_config.json`` would return a bare
        tokenizer either way.

        :attr:`processor` therefore stays ``None`` unless a real processor came
        back, which is what the rest of the job reads as "this model sees more
        than text". Its tokenizer is taken from inside it rather than loaded a
        second time, so the object the data pipeline reads through is the same
        object that gets exported. A model that reads no text at all (a DiT over
        latents) overrides this to load nothing.

        A path with no preprocessor to load is not fatal here — a toy config
        exercising the training loop on synthetic batches has none, and never
        asks for one. The warning names the path, and a job that does read text
        fails where it reads it.

        The template is the third thing a model needs before it can read text:
        the tokenizer says how a string becomes ids, the processor how pixels
        do, and the template how a *conversation* becomes a training sample —
        including the assistant-only label mask that no jinja can express. A
        trainer therefore never assembles one; it reads :attr:`chat_template`
        the way it reads :attr:`tokenizer`. Stays ``None`` when this model names
        none (plaintext, diffusion, a Qwen-Omni model that formats through its
        processor) and, with a warning, when a name *was* given but nothing
        loaded to build it from. A job that needs a template and named none
        fails where it uses one, in the data transform.
