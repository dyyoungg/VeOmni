- [Transformers v5 MoE weight loading](transformers_v5_moe_weight_loading.md): explains how VeOmni expects MoE expert weights for v5 and documents qwen3_moe handling.
- [Testing a new model](testing_new_model.md): SOP for adding test cases in `test_models_patch.py` and `test_e2e_parallel.py` when onboarding a new v5 model.
